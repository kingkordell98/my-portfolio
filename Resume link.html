        <p>Statistical Analysis - Project analyzing a small sample of clients of a telecom operator. The goal
            of this project was to determine which plan brought in more revenue.  
            Processed and combined extensive datasets from various sources with Pandas, guaranteeing data 
            reliability and uniformity for subsequent examination. Developed charts and pivot tables using Excel, 
            Seaborn, and Matplotlib to investigate trends and address critical business inquiries. Conducted statistical 
            evaluations via NumPy to detect patterns in consumer buying habits, delivering practical recommendations on 
            favored product types and gaming platforms. </p>

            <p>Exploratory Data Analysis- Project to analyze Video Game user behavior to uncover 
            trends and insights, leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques.
            Cleaned and merged large datasets from multiple sources using Pandas, ensuring data accuracy and consistency 
            for further analysis. Created visualizations and pivot tables with Excel, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore 
            patterns and answer key business questions. Performed statistical analysis with NumPy to identify trends in
